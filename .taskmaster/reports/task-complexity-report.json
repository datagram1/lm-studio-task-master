			"taskId": 108,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Basic Node.js Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Node.js project initialization into specific setup steps: 1) Initialize npm project with proper package.json configuration (ES modules, scripts, metadata), 2) Create directory structure (src/, test/, bin/), 3) Install and configure essential dependencies (commander, jest, core Node.js utilities), and 4) Set up basic configuration files and verify the project structure works correctly.",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward project setup task. The codebase shows established patterns for Node.js projects with ES modules. The complexity is low-moderate because it's mostly configuration and file creation, but requires attention to detail for proper ES module setup and dependency configuration matching the existing project patterns."

		{
			"taskId": 109,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Functionality Module",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the core functionality implementation into focused modules: 1) Design and create the main core.js module structure with proper exports, 2) Implement primary business logic functions with input validation, 3) Add comprehensive error handling and async operation support, 4) Create data processing and handling capabilities, and 5) Ensure modular, testable code structure following Node.js best practices seen in the existing codebase.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate-high complexity because it involves creating the main business logic without specific requirements details. The existing codebase shows sophisticated patterns with base classes, provider systems, and extensive error handling. The vague 'Feature B' reference suggests this needs careful architectural planning and multiple focused implementation phases."

		{
			"taskId": 110,
			"taskTitle": "Create CLI Interface and Testing Suite",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the CLI and testing implementation into systematic phases: 1) Set up Commander.js CLI structure with proper command definitions and help text, 2) Implement CLI commands with argument validation and error handling, 3) Create comprehensive unit test suite with Jest following existing patterns, 4) Develop integration tests for CLI commands and workflows, 5) Set up test coverage reporting and ensure 80% coverage target, and 6) Add end-to-end testing scenarios covering full user workflows.",
			"reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to multiple interconnected components. The existing codebase shows sophisticated CLI handling (bin/task-master.js with 377 lines), extensive test infrastructure (159+ test files), and complex command processing. Creating both CLI interface and comprehensive testing requires careful coordination and significant implementation work across multiple areas."
